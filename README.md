# Shot Timer
This mod shows the remaining time until the gun bloom effect wears off after firing the main battery.

This was originally developed by someone, not me. However, I do not know the author, and the project was discontinued.

# Install
1. Download a zip.
2. Unzip the archive, and you should get `gui`.
3. Move them to `(wows)/bin/(latest_number)/res_mods/`. So the path will look like `res_mods/gui`, etc.
4. Done!
